# Demo_REST-API_example
This is an Employee datadase. I created an api to access the data form the database through an api. I implimented CRUD operation thorough thi api.
If you use http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/users_list/ on Postman then it will return the data from the database. Also I have created another separate script named CLIENT, http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/
through this any existing user can also Create, Retrive, Update, and Delete any data from that database, through a security TOKEN.
