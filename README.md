# Demo_REST-API_example
This is an Employee database. I created an API to access the data from the database through an API. I implemented CRUD operation thorough this API. If you use http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/users_list/ on Postman then it will return the data from the database. Also, I have created another separate script named CLIENT, http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/ through this any existing user can also Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete any data from that database, through a security TOKEN.
